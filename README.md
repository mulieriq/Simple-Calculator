### Objective

Thanks for checking out Boya's front-end coding challenge. Using Dart and Flutter, your task is to build a simple mobile-first calculator app.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out a mobile-first calculator app that lets users perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **Dart**
    -   Framework: **Flutter**
    -   Your users should be able to:
        -   See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size (mobile only)
        -   Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
        -   Adjust the color theme based on their preference
        -   Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Dart** best practices
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
-   Documentation: is the API well-documented?
-   
### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
